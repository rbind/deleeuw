The two major R packages we are wroking on are the *smacof* package for multidimensional scaling, and the 
*gifi* package for multivariate analysis with optimal scaling. A major ongoing project is to replace
the R code in the packages by C code, wherever that makes sense. The two major reasons are:

1. it will make the programs run faster, and
2. I love to program in C.
