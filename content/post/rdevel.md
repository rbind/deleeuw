For more than 20 years my personal version of R has been the latest R-devel from svn, compiled on my own machines, with close to 2000 packages installed from source. No more of that. It's all vanity. I just downloaded the latest framework build from CRAN, with binary versions of about 150 packages. So much easier -- other people have done the work, have done it well, and will continue to do so.
