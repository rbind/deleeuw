The publication page now has links to the current state of the unfinished manuscripts of "Multivariate Analysis with Optimal Scaling" (under Multivariate Analysis, 2016) and "Block Relaxation Methods in Statistics" (under Optimization, 2016). There is some hope the first will at some point be in a more or less final form, for the second there is no hope at all.
