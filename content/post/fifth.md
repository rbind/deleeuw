+++
In many situations in numerical analysis least squares loss functions with diagonal weight matrices are much easier to minimize than least square loss functions with full positive semi-definite weight matrices. We use majorization to replace problems with a full weight matrix by a sequence of diagonal weight matrix problems. Diagonal weights which optimally approximate the full weights are computed using a simple semi-definite programming procedure.
