Yesterday I discovered that the original plat and survey maps of Portland subdivisions can be retrieved from [this URL](http://www3.multco.us/slv/?Viewer=SAIL). This saves me a lot of work -- I downloaded the 30 or so maps of the Piedmont subdivisions, which have all the names and dates I need. This runs from New Albina in 1883 to Origami in 2017. It allows me to move from the homesteads (1850-1880) to the subdivision plats (1880-1930).
