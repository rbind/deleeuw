Yesterday I discovered that the original plat and survey maps of Portland subdivisions can be retrieved from [here](http://www3.multco.us/slv/?Viewer=SAIL). This saves me a lot of work -- I downloaded the 30 or so maps of the Piedmont subdivisions, which have all the names and dates I need. This goes all the way from New Albina in 1883 to Origami in 2017.
