Not sure if I will ever finish these, but the incomplete versions make it pretty clear what needs to be added to make them complete. 
It's all perculating somewhere in my head, pretty much formulated, but writing it down is another matter. In the first paper the notion of sharp quadratic majorization is generalized using *fans* of majorizers. In the second paper formulas are given for the convergence rate of majorization algorithms with equality and/or inequality constraints.
