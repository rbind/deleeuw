So far most of my work has been on rectangular matrices with n observations on m variables. In other words, on dataframes.
There have been some exaceptions, such as more than one dataframe, one or more dissimilarity matrices, or multiway arrays
of various kinds. I am now planning to find out if the techniques I am familiar with can be extended in a natural way to 
spatial and space-time data.
