Multnomah County has an index of all deeds registered in the county. For my project, I am mostly interested in deeds between 1850 and 1892, which are in a file of about 1400 pages, each page with two columns of about 30 deeds. I will have to spend quite a lot of time at the Multnomah Building on Hawthorne Boulevard -- which used to be named Asylum Road.
