abstract = "We discuss the problem of finding an approximate solution to an overdetermined system of linear inequalities, or an exact solution if the system is consistent. Theory and R code is provided for four different algorithms. Two techniques use active set methods for non-negatively constrained least squares, one uses alternating least squares, and one uses a nonsmooth Newton method."
