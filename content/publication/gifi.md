abstract = "This is the next generation of Gifi's nonlinear multivariate analysis. The first generation ended with the 1990 Wiley book, the second with the 2009 JSS article. This version involves a complete rewrite of the software in a mixture of R and C, as well as a refactoring of the theory. This is an ever evolving manuscript which will be expanded/updated frequently. All suggestions for improvement are welcome. The directory gifi.stat.ucla.edu/gifi has a pdf version, the complete Rmd file with all code chunks, the bib file, the bookdown support files, the graphics, and the R and C source code."
