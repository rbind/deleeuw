abstract = "In the 1860s Evander Howe came from Vermont to Portland, and bought a 160 acre homestead in what is now the area where the Piedmont, Overlook, Humboldt, and Arbor Lodge neighborhoods meet. We know very little about Evander Howe. In this paper I give some of his background, and discuss what happened to his 160 acres."
