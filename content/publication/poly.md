abstract = "Given two vectors x and y of the same length n, the univariate interpolating polynomial p of degree nâˆ’1 has p(x_i) = y_i. We give code in C and R to compute the minimum of this interpolating polynomial, which is useful in cyclic coordinate descent algorithms. Various applications in data analysis are discussed."
