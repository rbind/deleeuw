abstract = "The Jacobi method for computing eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix is implemented in C using column-wise compact storage of the lower triangle. The complied C code can be loaded into R using the .C() interface. We compare the C implementation with an earlier version in pure R, and with the built-in eigen function in R."
