abstract = "We give necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of $A_j=XW_jX'$,
  with the $A_j$ are $m$ given positive semi-definite matrices of order $n$. The solution
  $X$ is $n\times p$ and the $m$ solutions $W_j$ are required to be diagonal, positive
  semi-definite, and adding up to the identity. We do not require that $p\leq n$."
