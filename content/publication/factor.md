abstract = "A general form of linear factor analysis is defined, and presented as a method to factor a data matrix, similar in many respects to principal component analysis. We discuss necessary and sufficient conditions for solvability of the factor analysis equations and give a constructive method to compute all solutions. A follow up paper will present the corresponding algorithm."
