abstract = "In De Leeuw (2008) we studied the derivatives of the least squares rank p approximation in the case of general rectangular matrices. We modify these results for the symmetric positive semi-definite case, using basically the same derivation. We apply the formulas to compute an expression for the convergence rate of Thomsons iterative principal component algorithm for factor analysis."
