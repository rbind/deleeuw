abstract = "We develop R and C code for Individual Differences Multidimensional Scaling, both for the INDSCAL and the IDIOSCAL case. In addition to the new SMACOF algorithms to minimize the stress loss function we use expressions for the second derivatives with respect to the group configuration and the individual weights to compute perturbation ellipsoids."
