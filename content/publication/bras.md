abstract = "This book discusses block relaxation, alternating least squares, augmentation, and majorization algorithms to minimize loss functions, with applications in statistics, multivariate analysis, and multidimensional scaling. This is a work in progress which will be expanded/updated frequently and unpredictably. It will never be finished, or, more precisely, it will be finished when I am. All suggestions for improvement are welcome. At gifi.stat.ucla.edu/bras there is a pdf version of the book, the Rmd file with all the code chunks, the tex, md, and html files, the figures, the R code, and whatever else is needed for perfect reproducibility."
