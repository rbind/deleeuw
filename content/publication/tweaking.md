abstract = "The smacof algorithm for (metric, Euclidean, least squares) multidimensional scaling is rewritten so that all computation is done in C, with only the data management, memory allocation, iteration counting, and I/O handled by R. All symmetric matrices use compact, lower triangular, column-wise storage. Second derivatives of the loss function are provided, but non-metric scaling, individual differences, and constraints still have to be added."
