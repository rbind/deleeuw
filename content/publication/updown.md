abstract = "We give an algorithm, with R code, to minimize the multidimensional scaling stress loss function under the condition that some or all of the fitted distances are between given positive upper and lower bounds. This paper combines theory, algorithms, code, and results of De Leeuw (2017b) and De Leeuw (2017a)."
