abstract = "The positive orthant method tries to find solutions to consistent systems of inequalities, and approximate solutions to inconsistent systems, by maximizing a fit measure based on the sign function and the absolute value function. We concentrate on the case of linear systems and develop a convergent majorization algorithm."
