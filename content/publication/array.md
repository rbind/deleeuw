abstract = "For multidimensional arrays and symmetric arrays in compact storage the mapping of R array indices to C storage locations and its inverse can be complicated. This short note discusses and implements a systematic way of handling this mapping for vectors, general matrices, symmetric matrices in compact storage, general multidimensional arrays, and super-symmetric multidimensional arrays."
